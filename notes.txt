POST COMPONENT
- why is the caption text centered?
- how to make sure some props don't conflict? like, if pub == true, postImages can't be true
- figure out how to make tags and more actions section open and close in the same amount of time
- for later: lightbox for post images when clicked on
- do i want the tags and more actions tabs to always close together? what if i opened the tags first then the more actions
