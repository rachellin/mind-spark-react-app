POST COMPONENT
- why is the caption text centered?
- how to make sure some props don't conflict? like, if pub == true, postImages can't be true
- figure out how to make tags and more actions section open and close in the same amount of time
- do i want the tags and more actions tabs to always close together? what if i opened the tags first then the more actions
- if the user uploads video, then they can't upload more media
- show tags section if post has no tags?
- figure out props for date etc later w api 
- for non pubs, go to post page when the whole container is clicked on?


POSTER
- why does tag go to the next line when there's a space in it
- horizontal scroll or sth for the tags (tags will have to shift to the left so that the input box doesn't disappear)
- show button for poster modal when user scrolls past poster
